# YouTube Converter

This Python script allows you to download audio from YouTube videos or playlists and convert them into MP3 format. It leverages libraries such as `pytube` for downloading videos, `moviepy` for audio conversion, and `youtubesearchpython` for searching videos by name.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using the provided `module_needed.bat` file or manually via pip:

```sh
pip install pytube moviepy youtubesearchpython tqdm
```

## Usage

### Initialization

Create an instance of the `YoutubeConverter` class:

```python
YTC = YoutubeConverter()
```

### Download a Single Song

You can download a song by providing its URL:

```python
YTC.Song_Download(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NzfqW_Yt6Y")
```

Alternatively, you can search and download a song by name:

```python
YTC.Song_Download(name="Pedro Pedro Pedro - Racoon Meme")
```

### Download a Playlist

Download all audio files from a YouTube playlist:

```python
YTC.Playlist_Download(url="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeXK5fifcFg83k9U8Cs1Y30Vgcs-sscCQ&feature=shared")
```

### Configuration Options

- `time_wait`: The time to wait between processing each file (default is 0.2 seconds).
- `path`: The path to save the converted files. If not specified, it defaults to the Downloads folder.
- `playlist`: The name of the playlist, used to create a subdirectory under the specified path.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```python
# Initialize the converter
YTC = YoutubeConverter()

# Download a song by URL
YTC.Song_Download(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NzfqW_Yt6Y")

# Search and download a song by name
YTC.Song_Download(name="Pedro Pedro Pedro - Racoon Meme")

# Download all songs from a playlist
YTC.Playlist_Download(url="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeXK5fifcFg83k9U8Cs1Y30Vgcs-sscCQ&feature=shared")
```

## Additional Information

The script will create a temporary directory to store downloaded audio files before conversion. After conversion, files are moved to the specified directory or the Downloads folder by default.

## Error Handling

If the necessary libraries are not installed, the script will prompt you to install them using `module_needed.bat` and then exit.
